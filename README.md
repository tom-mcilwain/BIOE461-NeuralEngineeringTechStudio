Title: ThinkArt - EEG-Controlled Digital Paint Platform

Abstract: In this course we were asked to design a novel neural interface application for use in the real world. My team and I designed an interface that allowed a user to create digital art using their thoughts, recorded via an EEG. We tested using OpenBCI equipment and EMG sensors prior to EEG use. This repository contains some code that was produced during this project.
